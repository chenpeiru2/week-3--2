<h1 style="color:red;">Spatial power in roadblocks</h1>

<p style="color:black;">
    I want to do a data collection on the type and number of barricades in public space, in a specific area to be determined.</p>
    The barricades in the city represent a kind of zoning, and I want to use the shape and number of barricades to correspond to the functions and owners of the urban areas to which they relate, in order to understand the spatial 'attitudes' of different cultural or functional areas, i.e. whether the relationship between space and people is antagonistic, confrontational or harmonious and equal.</p>
From what Iâ€™ve tasted of desire</p>
IThe spatial politics of the city reflects the inclusiveness and power of the city. Urban social spaces are discursive and real entities with real and sensual qualities, each having a 'different place' in the system of urban relations. Each urban social space has an 'identity', defined by its particular mix of social groups and their particular real and sensual qualities. Urban social spaces are thus formed through multiple interrelationships. The division of social space from oppositional to inclusive is a reflection of the relationship between society and politics.
</p>
The roadblocks actually reflect a division of power. For example, in a paper on the exclusivity of roadblocks in the Andean Mountains, it is mentioned that foreign extractors have set up defensive fronts in the southern part of Puno because of conflicts with the indigenous people over the exploitation of natural resources. The indigenous people see the mountains and natural resources not only as a material benefit but also as a spiritual aspiration and a sacred place for their gods, while in the eyes of the extractors the unexplored area is a good place to make them rich, so the conflict is based on a clash of civilisations and economies, and a struggle between the power of the outsiders and the indigenous people. I was struck by one of the many roadblock-related disputes cited in the article, as some people even died fighting for the right to space. An elderly woman in her 60s tried to clear a blocked bridge and was killed by a tear gas canister fired by the police. At this point the barricade is no longer what it is in itself, but a direct manifestation of politics in space.</p>
To sum up, I think that knowing information about roadblocks is a good way to understand the culture and politics of an area, a city, and I would love to make an attempt at information gathering with this.</p>
